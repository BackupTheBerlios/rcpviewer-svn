			An implementation of Petstore using RcpViewer.
		</p>
		<p>
			<i><b>Note that the features described in these pages are not
		    necessarily completely implemented.</b></i>
		</p>
		<p>
			Petstore was originally developed by Sun as an blueprint of using
			various J2EE applications.  Although their initial implementation 
			has (in some quarters) been somewhat maligned, Petstore nevertheless
			has become something of a benchmark by which to judge application 
			frameworks.  Indeed, Microsoft have provided an implementation of 
			Petstore on .NET, as well as many other open source frameworks.
		</p>
		<p>
			This implementation of Petstore is therefore to allow you to see
			how to develop an application using RcpViewer.  It was initially
			based on one of two implementation done by Herve Tchepannou using 
			servlets along with Hibernate.  We took the POJOs that made up 
			Herve's domain model and have added functionality and semantics as
			required.  (The rest, of course, we threw away).
		</p>
		<p>
			The Java classes in this example application are well commented.  
			For many methods you will see an italicised section <i>Programming
			Model notes</i>.  This points out some of the salient aspects of the
			code with respect to coding conventions and annotations pertinent
			to writing applications under RcpViewer.  Since many of these 
			conventions occur time-and-again (eg whether an attribute is 
			optional or mandatory), some of the more common conventions are
			documented below.  When the comments say "See overview for 
			discussion on other programming model conventions and annotations",
			it is referring to this page.
		</p>
		<h2> Constructors </h2>
		<p> Constructors are always no-arg, to allow the platform (specifically,
			the persistence layer) to re-create instances. </p>
		<h2> Attributes</h2>
		<p> Common annotations for attributes: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> The <code>@Order</code> annotation determines ordering relative to 
				other attributes, references and collections. </li>
			<li> The <code>@DescribedAs</code> annotation provides tooltip text in 
				the UI.</li>
			<li> Attributes are either mutable or immutable. They will be 
				mutable only if there is a mutator with <code>public</code> 
				visibility. Immutable attributes also need a mutator so that
				the platform can initialize the attribute when the object is
				re-created from the persistent object store; however the 
				visibility will be <code>private</code>. </li>
			<li> Attributes are mandatory unless there is a <code>@Optional</code>
				annotation </li>
			<li> For string attribute the <code>@MaxLengthOf</code>
				annotation determines the maximum length of the string.</li>
		    <li> Similarly, for string attributes the <code>@MinLengthOf</code> 
				annotation can be used to indicates a minimum length.  However,
				note that unless an attribute has been marked as 
				<code>@Optional</code>, even without this annotation the user 
				will nevertheless have to enter at least 1 character. </li>
			<li> Some string attributes will have a <code>@FieldLengthOf</code>
				annotation indicating the field's length in the UI.  This will
				be used if the <code>@MaxLengthOf</code> is too long.  If omitted,
				then the field length will be defaulted from the 
				<code>@MaxLengthOf</code> annotation.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2> Collections </h2>
		<p> Common conventions and annotations for references representing 
			collections:</p>
		<ul>
			<li> The <code>@Order</code> annotation determines ordering relative to 
				other attributes, references and collections. </li>
			<li> The <code>@DescribedAs</code> annotation provides tooltip text in 
				the UI.</li>
			<li>
				The <code>@TypeOf</code> annotation indicates the type of object 
				that is held in this collection.  It should be the same as the
				parameter of the generic collection type of the instance 
				variable that represents the collection.
			</li>
			<li> Generally speaking, if there is a  <code>addTo...</code> method
				 with <code>public</code> visibility then the UI will allow 
				 objects of the same type to be added to the collection using drag/drop.  However, if the collection
				 is also annotated as a <code>@ContainerOf</code> then this
				 functionality is disabled.  The reasoning is that objects in
				 the collection are wholly contained by the containing object,
				 and so it should have complete control over the adding of
				 objects to the collection.
				 </li>
		    <li> Objects can be removed from the collection because of the
				<code>removeFrom...</code> method.  This is allowed even if
				the collection is annotated with <code>@ContainerOf</code>.
				</li>
		    <li> As well as being part of the coding conventions, the 
				<code>addTo...</code> and <code>removeFrom...</code> methods
				make it easy for the domain programmer to implement 
				bidirectional relationships.  The suggested style is that
				one object takes responsibility for maintaining the references
				for both objects involved in the relationship; the other simply
				delegates.
			</li>
			<li> In addition to the <code>addTo...</code> and 
				<code>removeFrom...</code> methods, the object must also provide
				a mutator (<code>set...</code>).  This need only have 
				<code>private</code> visibility and should not be called by the
				domain object itself, however it is required by the platform 
				to manage persistence of referenced objects transparently.
				</li>
		</ul>
		<h2> Operations</h2>
		<p> Common annotations for operations: </p>
		<ul>
			<li> The <code>@Order</code> annotation determines the ordering of the
				 operation in the UI relative to other operations.
				 <ul>
				<li> However, any operation annotated as the <code>@SaveOperation</code>
					 are always rendered using <i>File>Save</i>, and so the 
					 <code>@Order</code> annotation, if present, is ignored.</li>
				 </ul>
			</li>
			<li> The <code>@DescribedAs</code> annotation for an operation provides 
				tooltip text in the UI.</li>
				<li> 1-arg operations that accept a domain should be rendered in
					 the UI as a drag-n-drop operation.</li>
			<li> Operation parameters are mandatory unless they are annotated as
				 <code>@Optional</code>.</li>
			<li> If there is no <code>@Named</code> annotation then the name of 
				  each operation parameter is defaulted from the name of its 
				  (compile-time) type. </li>
			<li> The <code>@DescribedAs</code> annotation for an operation 
				parameter provides tooltip text for that parameter in the UI.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2> Dependency Injection </h2>
		<p> Some domain objects will have an <code>IAppContainer</code> injected
			into them (with a <code>setAppContainer(IAppContainer)</code> 
			method.  One common use is so that an object can determine its 
			state in the persistence lifecycle.  Another case where application 
			containers are used is for objects that create or delete other 
			objects.</p>
