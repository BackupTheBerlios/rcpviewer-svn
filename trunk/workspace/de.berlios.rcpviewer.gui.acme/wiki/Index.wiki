1 Extending the example

If you want to develop some more realistic pojos, then these are the steps:
* create POJO classes
* for each class:
** ensure all class has @InDomain annotation
** add each class as an ~~de.berlios.rcpviewer.gui.domainclass extension~~ in plugin.xml 
* er, that's it!
