1 Mike's Spike 3

This is a real spike - no more hand holding.  Its aim is to look at how to implement a form editor for a generic object instance.
* (to run the application up, define an Eclipse application run configuration - spike 2 has an example)

~~Set Up~~
Based on the mikespike2 code with the following (initial differences):
* 'God' singleton has been swapped for rather more tasteful 'Model'
* this handles arbitary objects
* the model starts with a simple 'EasyBean' class that is bean of String values randomly created on creation
* the start-up view (ObjectListView) is now a list of all __instances__ within the model

If you run the app without any argument then the model auto-populates with a random number of instances.  Add the -test argument and it will start empty and expect to be filled by unit tests.  The test class is in a package within this project as this is a real spike so I am not really doing test-driven development.

Treat all of this as boilerplate.  The stuff to look at happens in the createPartControl( Composite ) method of DefaultEditor and in the mikespike3.gui package.

~~Limitations~~
* Only thinking about presentation here - not any other functionality.
* Still not using EMF model as a distraction

~~ Initial Design ~~
Focussing only on FormEditor's.  Two core types, IFormBuilder and IFieldBuilder.  The former deals with overall layout, the second with the display of an individual field.  

Each has an isApplicable() method which is passed the class and the instance.  The latter arg may seem overkill but might be required for null values and where a user develops specialist editors, for e.g., different states of the instance.

The implementation used is decided by Factories.  Their strategies differ.

The FieldBuilderFactory runs through all implementations of the 'mikespike3.fieldbuilder' extension point until it hits the first that isApplicable().  If none are found it reverts to the DefaultFieldBuilder.  Note that the extension points are sorted so that more specialist ones are checked first.  What does 'more specialist' mean? - see ConfigElementSorter in the util package (this is an old implemenattion that might be more elegantly done in Eclipse 3.x).

The FormBuilderFactory simply uses the DefaultFormBuilder.

~~ Issues Raised~~
* How will I distinguish first class objects (with their own editors) with dependent objects (in groups on the parent editor)? 
DAN says: metaModel.classes() should return you all IDomainClass's that are known.  For those that are dependent, there will be (isn't yet) an eReference up to their parent IDomainClass.  So I guess what you want is for the MetaModel to do this filtering for you automatically, eg an overload like metaModel.classes(onlyFirstClass)???

* Both IFormBuilder and IFieldBuilder have the same contract - does this indicate that they are really one and the same thing?

* The extension point order can become arbitary if different extension plugins are added. How solve?

~~ Likely Annotation Requirements ~~
* size and wrapping for text fields
