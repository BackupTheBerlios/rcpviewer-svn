'''Design Points'''
* Side-stepping Domain initialisation at the moment by use of DomainInitialiserFactory so that whatever Dan & Ted finalise on can be accomodated easily.
* DomainInitialiserFactory returns a Job that actually carries out the work.  This is strictly unecessary at the moment (indeed necesitates a join() call in plugin's startup()) but wrapping such long / heavy operations such as this in Job is one of my suggested standards.




'''Suggested Standards'''
* wrap all log / complex operations in Job's
* 'eat your own dogfood' for all extension points  '''unless''' the fall-back default option; hecnce 'exts' sub-directories where extension points are implemented
