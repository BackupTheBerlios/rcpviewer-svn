- and for each, do a resolve.  make into a Resolve aspect which subclasses PojoAspect.

---------
thinking about ObjectStore:


findUsing(IQuery): List<IPojo>

- provide an implementation of IQuery that restricts to all instances of a single type
- every IPojo will be resolved, and with a IPersistedId

resolve(IPersistedId): IPojo
- locates the object
- copies over the attributes


resolve(IPojo, IReference)

the implementation should


when ask for a pojo, it should copy over the attributes and set references to null and IReference.resolveState = false
