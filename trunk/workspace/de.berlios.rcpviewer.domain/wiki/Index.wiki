1 Introduction

The plugins fall into two main categories:
* the GUI plugins
** Eclipse:/de.berlios.rcpviewer.gui/wiki/Index.wiki
*** this needs to be merged with Eclipse:/de.berlios.rcpviewer.rcp/wiki/Index.wiki)
** Eclipse:/de.berlios.rcpviewer.gui.acme/wiki/Index.wiki
* the metamodel plugins, including (sketches of) sessions and persistence:
** basically, everything else.

The GUI plugins can be run as an RCP application, very very basic at the moment.

The Metamodel plugins provide a full set of tests that can be run either as simple JUnit tests, or - as they are ultimately to be used by the GUI plugins - can be run as JUnit plugin tests.


1 About this plugin
Defines the API and partial implementation to describe a domain (a collection of domain classes).  Designed to be extended either at runtime (by implementations that use Java reflection) or at compile-time (by implementations that use Java AST).

Every project has a wiki/Index.wiki which makes it easy to link to.  Many of the metamodel plugins cross reference back to here, though.
