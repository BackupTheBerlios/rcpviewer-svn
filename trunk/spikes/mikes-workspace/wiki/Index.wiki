'''General Notes'''

'''Runtime Configuration'''
You can use the default configuration set up by Eclipse simply using the right-click option 'Run As / JUnit Plugin Test' off one of the test classes.
However it is nicer to define your own configuartion only using the necessary plugins:
* generate your own configuration
* select the option to choose your own plugins
* select this plugin and then click the 'Add Required Plugins' buttons - this will give you the minimal set needed to run these tests.
* note! remember to switch the application that starts to the gui application rather than the eclipse workbench (on the Main tab under 'Program To Run') else you'll get startup errors
