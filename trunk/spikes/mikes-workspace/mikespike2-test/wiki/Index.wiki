1 Mike's Spike 2

~~ Introduction ~~
This spike is about developing a basic RcpViewer GUI prototype using test-driven development.  Hence this wiki is in the 'test' project rather than the 'runtime' project as from now on test precede and control development.  

This 'test' project itself started out as a cut'n'pasted version of mikespike1-test, whilst mikespike2-runtime was created via the new project plug-in wizard, selecting an RCP application and choosing the Hello World template (I fiddled with some of the names/ids).

Creating a runtime configuration for the mikespike2-runtime plugins only (and its required plugins) will show that the wizard has done its work and runs up an empty RCP app window.

__Note__ : in addtion configure mikespike2-runtime to export the core eclipse plugins it is dependent upon.

~~ Development ~~
Is all controlled from the Test class now.  Each iteration creates a test, runs it, fails and then add the implementation to make the test pass.  Good ol' XP.  So all other notes and explanations of reside in the javadoc of each test.  I realise you are presented with the end implementation of all tests but I hope by following each subsequent test's javadoc you'll get a handle on my thought processes.

__Note__ : you'll nedd to create a JUnit Plugin Test configuartion using only the two mikespike2 plugins and their requisite plugins.
