Have moved most over to code, however this one remains:

Generation control flags (reference, from http://download.eclipse.org/tools/emf/scripts/docs.php?doc=references/overview/EMF.html)

(we will use to represent equivalent semantics)

* ResolveProxies (default is true)

ResolveProxies only applies to non-containment references. ResolveProxies implies that the reference may span documents, and therefore needs to include proxy checking and resolution in the get method, as described earlier in this paper.

You can optimize the generated get pattern for references that you know will never be used in a cross document scenario by setting resolveProxies to false. In that case, the generated get method will be optimally efficient[21] .
      

~~Reckon this will be useful when doing links... (hibernate/EJB3 hint for lazy loading)~~
